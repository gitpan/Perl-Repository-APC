2003-09-14: 5.6.2 and 5.6.3 are currently both branched from 5.6.1. We
    have no metadata that tell us this fact, the program needs to know
    it. Rev. 124 enables us to survive under this condition for a
    while, but it seems that we need to address this sooner or later.
    I expect the next breakage when 5.6.2 will be out. Then we will
    probably not be able to build 5.6.3.

    At least rev 127 will be able to handle 5.6.2 both for buildaperl
    and apc2svn. To get the current state of 5.6.2, you want to call

    buildaperl  --branch maint-5.6/perl-5.6.2 @

    For the record: buildaperl started to work again in rev 124,
    apc2svn seems to work before I'm committing 127. Both were not
    working for 5.6.2 in rev 123. binsearchaperl also needed a special
    case for 5.6.2 which I committed in rev 130.
