	* Why fails 5.6.2 test 6 of trimtrees?

	Changed md5 to md5_hex for better debugging. Nope.

	Changed the content of the 4 provoking files: Yupp. Because the
	way through the find is different for 5.6.2 it took a file with
	that content from somewhere else.

	* finish trimtrees.t and put it in MANIFEST

	* Bug in eg/trimtrees.pl: not portable due to $slashes counting
	slashes instead of dirsep or how it is called.

	Local Variables:
	mode: change-log
	change-log-default-name: "Todo"
	End:
