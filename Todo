	* Patch 31047 breaks patchaperlup because it moves a couple of
	directories to new places. But the APC patch files do not contain
	directory removal information, so old directories can only be
	removed by removing all empty directories.

	* Mac OS X with its case tolereant file system isn't able to run
	APC with the same level of reliance. We must skip errors that are
	due to filenamespace overlaps and must take care that these files
	are not removed later. -- Update 2007-04-24 akoenig : nope, won't
	do. This suite does not work on case tolerant filesystems, period.
	It's a nightmare to work around case tolerant filesystems, makes
	no sense to implement within this module. Needs a higher level
	approach.

	* Why fails 5.6.2 test 6 of trimtrees?

	# tlds[10]cur[9]uniq[2]fils[4_000]spcused[2]saved[0]Cannot rename "tmp/0/BAD\cJNL0" to "./trimtrees1-jmftIUAw" (Permission denied); Skipping. at eg/trimtrees.pl line 55.

# Cannot read "tmp/0/BAD\cJNL3" (Permission denied); Skipping. at eg/trimtrees.pl line 163.
# 

	Changed md5 to md5_hex for better debugging. Nope.

	Changed the content of the 4 provoking files: Yupp. Because the
	way through the find is different for 5.6.2 it took a file with
	that content from somewhere else.

	FIXED by changing the contents of the fault-provoking files. The
	order of walking through the trees has slightly changed and that
	lead to a different order faults during the test.

	* finish trimtrees.t and put it in MANIFEST

	* Bug in eg/trimtrees.pl: not portable due to $slashes counting
	slashes instead of dirsep or how it is called.

	Local Variables:
	mode: change-log
	change-log-default-name: "Todo"
