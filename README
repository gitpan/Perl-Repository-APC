About this distro
-----------------

This collection of scripts and modules provides access to the APC (All
Perl Changes) archive:

* The module Perl::Repository::APC provides methods to get at the
  important metadata of the APC: branches, perl versions and patches.

* The script patchaperlup is a low level script that only builds new
  perl sources from old perl sources by applying numerically sorted
  patchfiles.

* The script buildaperl is a wrapper around patchaperlup that is able
  to compile and install a new perl into its own cache area.

* The script binsearchaperl is a wrapper around buildaperl that is
  able to run already built perls from the cache area, build new perls
  via buildaperl and compare their functionality. If there is a
  different behaviour between two perls, the script is able to
  determine the exact patch number that caused the change.

* The module Perl::Repository::APC2SVN is a collection of utility
  functions for the scripts that deal with importing the APC into a
  Subversion repository.

* The scripts perlpatch2svn and apc2svn are still alpha quality. Do
  not use them yet.
