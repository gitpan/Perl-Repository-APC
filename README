About this distro
-----------------

This collection of scripts and modules provides access to the APC (All
Perl Changes) archive:

* The module Perl::Repository::APC provides methods to get at the
  important metadata of the APC

* The script patchaperlup is a low level script that only builds new
  perl sources from old perl sources by applying numerically sorted
  patchfiles.

* The script buildaperl is a wrapper around patchaperlup that is able
  to compile and install a new perl.

* The script binsearchaperl is a wrapper around buildaperl that is
  able to run already built perls, build new perls and compare their
  functionality. If there is a different behaviour between two perls,
  the script is able to determine the exact patch number that caused
  the change.
