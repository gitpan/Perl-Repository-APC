2008-11-28  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.7os6VVqR@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Release 2.002:

	Workaround for broken patch 34882: supply the whole file
	t/op/regexp_unicode_prop_thr.t from within the script.

2008-03-08  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.7os6VVqR@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Release 2.001:

	Unchanged stable release. For the changes between the 1.276 release and
	this release, read below.

2008-02-22  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.7os6VVqR@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Release around 2.000_294:

	* Adding support for 5.10.1. Tiny improvements to code readability by
	adding labels and changing bad variable names.

2008-01-25  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.7os6VVqR@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Release around 2.000_284:

	* The APC has got a new directory with additional tarballs (thanks to
	Phillippe Chiasson) so we can drop the README.additional_tarballs and
	simplify the documentation.

	Leaving the underscore in the version number to test the package for a
	while.

2008-01-20  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.7os6VVqR@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Release around 2.000_280:

	* Support for additional tarballs that are currently not in the APC. See
	README.additional_tarballs for instructions how to enable the new
	feature by copying your favorite tarballs to a new selfmade directory.

	With this release we support 15 more tarballs than those in the APC,
	which results in a muchly reduced time for patching.

	The internal datastructures have changed, so we make this a dev release
	and inc the major version number. In principle all changes should be
	backwards compatible: P:R:BAP->translate returns a fifth element.
	P:R:APC->tarball looks into more directories than it did before and may
	return an absolute path, no other changes in the modules are visible to
	the scripts.

2008-01-03  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.7os6VVqR@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Release around 1.275:

	* bugfix: address https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=32052 --
	set LD_LIBRARY_PATH when calling ./perl.

2007-11-11  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.7os6VVqR@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Release around 1.272:

	* bugfix: check the exit status of prep scripts and if they fail rerun
	them up to two times. That prevents bad results in scenarios with
	complex upgrade scripts.

2007-09-09  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.7os6VVqR@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Release around 1.249:

	* applied a patch from Father Chrysostomos to integrate better into OS X
	environment

	* I wanted to look into CPANTS if there were any issues open but they
	were closed for maintainance

2007-04-24  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.7os6VVqR@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Release around 1.243:

	* remove empty directories immediately because the APC patch files do
	not contain directory removal information, as patch 31047 painfully
	demonstrated.

	* document under BUGS that patchaperlup does not work on case tolerant
	filesystems.

2007-02-14  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.7os6VVqR@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Release around 1.239:

	* perl 5.6.2 failed one test due to different walk through find(). Only
	the badly constructed test needed fixing

	misfeature)

	parallel
