	* checked everything into subversion

	* Started APC.pm

	* Integrated patchaperlup (and the whole ChangeLog from there) to
	make this a complete toolset for playing with APC

	* Search for patchls in the path and in Porting directory. Old
	perls didn't have it.

	* Protect against the case that "Changes" doesn't help us (as in
	old perls)

	* Don't try to apply patches that contain no /^Index/ line.

	* Take precautions when removing files not present in MANIFEST:
	warn if testfiles would be deleted. Thanks to Hugo for the
	suggestion.

2001-09-07  k  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Speedup: apply unCR only if needed. 

	* Patches since 5.7.2 had some ^M anomalies that needed to be
	addressed. We now unCR all patched files more often than needed
	and unCR all patches. Works for me with patch 2.5.4 for all of
	perl-5.7.0, 5.7.1, and 5.7.2.

2000-11-02  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Updated documentation

	* Made it a little bit more tolerant against patch errors that can
	be ignored. I want to improve these over time. Patches welcome.

2000-02-27  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Releasing 0.004.

	* Fixed report of problem patches.

	* Documented extending the abilities by collecting all patches
	into a single diff directory and producing any patchlevel from
	5.005_58 in one shot.
