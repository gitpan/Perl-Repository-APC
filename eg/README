care, which means, read the source before use.

Makefile

    this is what I have in the build directory above APC. One call to
    make(1) fetches the latest patches for the branches I want to
    watch and builds bleading perl. The cleanup procedure at the end
    is quite interesting, it uses rm-rf-allbutlatest.pl,
    thinnercache.pl and trimtrees.pl

configdiff.pl

    Takes as argument two perls and shows the difference in their
    Config.pm files.

rm-rf-allbutlatest.pl

    Removes all build but the latest directories used by buildaperl in
    the current directory.

test_full_apc.pl

    I used this to test if I can at least patch up to any version we
    have in the repository. I didn't configure and compile them all
    though. This would take a whole day or more.

thinnercache.pl

    Removes perls from the cache in stalled-perls/. Scans the cache
    and suggests to remove the perls first that are close to each
    other, historically. Has the --max option to run as a batch job.

trimtrees.pl

    Replaces identical files in the cache with hard links. Of course
    it only works where hard links work.

zgrep-all-diffs.pl

    On my system the maximum argument list is exceeded when I say
    C<APC/**/diffs/*.gz>. So I wrote this small perl script to quickly
    zgrep all diff files.
