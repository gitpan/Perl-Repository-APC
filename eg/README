Makefile

    this is what I have in the build directory below APC. One call to
    make fetches the latest patches for the branches I want to watch
    and builds bleading perl

test_full_apc.pl

    I used this to test if I can at least patch up to any version we
    have in the repository. I didn't configure and compile them all
    though. This would take a whole day or more.
